# Radioactive Science
Navuis-specific science for all things uranium-related. In addition to needing uranium mined from the surface of Nauvis, it can only be crafted on Nauvis as well. Give Nauvis the planet-specific science treatment that all the other planets got in space age!

Makes centrifuges placeable only on Nauvis and changes centrifuge recipes to be only doable on Nauvis as well. Likely incompatible with any mod that uses the centrifuge as a part of its crafting chain!
